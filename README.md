# Machine learning for computer vision study project
Some code for implementation of various machine learning algorithms for computer vision, in particular classification and object detection. 
I'll put some jupyter/google colab notebooks here, as well as python files, in which I implement various famous algorithms using neural networks for computer vision tasks. 
Also hopefully some use of OpenCV, eventually.
